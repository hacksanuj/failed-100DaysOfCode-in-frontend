# Day 3️⃣

Yup, It's Day 3 of 100daysofcode. I have completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 course from freecodecamp you can also check this course: [responsive web design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design).

I belive that you understand concepts better when you apply them by yourself.

So I made a survey form on Anime and Manga, which I really enjoy.


So how I heck I made it:
- **In head section**
  - title tag to gave a name to my survey
- Then **In body section** after using form tag
  - used h1 to give a heading
  - used input tag to take the input from user, like name, country and fav anime.
    - In this I have also used attributes like size, maxlength, value, placeholder etc.
  - Then I have use **buttons**
    - radio buttons
    - checkbox buttons 
    - option buttons

That's what I made today. IT's great to implement what you learnt. That he best way to learn.
