# Day 

WOW, its day 8 of 100daysofcode. I have finished the Basic CSS course from Freecode camp, laerned some really cool stuff from this course. 
You can also follow this amazing course here: [Basic CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-css) 

So, What the hack I learned Today:
- what !important does in css
- hexcode and its property in CSS
- RGB
- CSS variable (didn't know we can make variable in CSS, I was shocked when I learned we can)
- Browser fallbacks (Its a pretty intresting concept)
