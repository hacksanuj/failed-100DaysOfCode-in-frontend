# Day 

Yup, It's Day 7 of 100daysofcode. I have started learning CSS from none other than FreeCodeCamp it's called Basic CSS. 
You can also follow this amazing course here: [Basic CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-css) 

So, What the hack I learned Today:
- who to change **background-color**
- **ID** in CSS + diffrence b/w ID and Classes
- **Padding** and its usage
- **Margin** and its usage 
- Learned about **Clockwise notation** in Margin and Padding
- Attribute Selector
- CSS Inheritance.(I won't lie it's confusing as fuck)
