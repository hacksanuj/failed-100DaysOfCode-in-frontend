# Day 

Yup, It's Day 5 of 100daysofcode. I have completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 course from freecodecamp you can also check this course: [responsive web design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design).

I belive that you understand concepts better when you apply them by yourself.

So I start making my porfolio, becasue it import that people can see your work.

That's what I made today. IT's great to implement what you learnt. That he best way to learn.
